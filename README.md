### Application
The code was used for the dissertation of Jonas Karthein and for several scientific presentations.

### Introduction
The following code was written to provide publication-ready plots of the nuclear chart, based on the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2016 [1] and the style of the Karlsruhe Nuclide Chart [2]

### Required software and libraries
The following code was written in Python 3.7. The required libraries are listed below with a rough description for their task in the code. It doesn't claim to be a full description of the library.

- pandas (data storage and calculation)<br/>
- numpy (calculation)<br/>
- matplotlib (plotting)<br/>
- jupyter (Python notebook environment)<br/>

All packages can be fetched using pip:

`pip3 install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter`
